	the problem of optimally controlling a supply chain subject to stochastic

	approach takes into account the uncertainty of the demand in the
	supply chain without assuming a specific distribution, while remaining
	highly tractable and providing insight into the corresponding optimal
	policy. It also allows adjustment of the level of robustness of the
	solution to trade off performance and protection against uncertainty.
	An attractive feature of the proposed approach is its numerical tractability,
	especially when compared to multidimensional dynamic programming
	problems in complex supply chains, as the robust problem is of the
	same difficulty as the nominal problem, that is, a linear programming
	problem when there are no fixed costs, and a mixed-integer programming
	problem when fixed costs are present. Furthermore, we show that the
	optimal policy obtained in the robust approach is identical to the
	optimal policy obtained in the nominal case for a modified and explicitly
	computable demand sequence. In this way, we show that the structure
	of the optimal robust policy is of the same base-stock character
	as the optimal stochastic policy for a wide range of inventory problems
	in single installations, series systems, and general supply chains.

  abstract = {We propose a general methodology based on robust optimization to address
	the problem of optimally controlling a supply chain subject to stochastic
	demand in discrete time. This problem has been studied in the past
	using dynamic programming, which suffers from dimensionality problems
	and assumes full knowledge of the demand distribution. The proposed
	approach takes into account the uncertainty of the demand in the
	supply chain without assuming a specific distribution, while remaining
	highly tractable and providing insight into the corresponding optimal
	policy. It also allows adjustment of the level of robustness of the
	solution to trade off performance and protection against uncertainty.
	An attractive feature of the proposed approach is its numerical tractability,
	especially when compared to multidimensional dynamic programming
	problems in complex supply chains, as the robust problem is of the
	same difficulty as the nominal problem, that is, a linear programming
	problem when there are no fixed costs, and a mixed-integer programming
	problem when fixed costs are present. Furthermore, we show that the
	optimal policy obtained in the robust approach is identical to the
	optimal policy obtained in the nominal case for a modified and explicitly
	computable demand sequence. In this way, we show that the structure
	of the optimal robust policy is of the same base-stock character
	as the optimal stochastic policy for a wide range of inventory problems
	in single installations, series systems, and general supply chains.
	Preliminary computational results are very promising.},

	inequality constrained optimization problems. This method uses a
	linearly constrained positive semidefinite quadratic problem to generate
	a feasible descent direction at each iteration. Under mild assumptions,
	the algorithm is shown to be globally convergent in the sense that
	every accumulation point of the sequence generated by the algorithm
	is a Fritz-John point of the problem. We introduce a Fritz-John (FJ)
	function, an FJ1 strong second-order sufficiency condition (FJ1-SSOSC),
	and an FJ2 strong second-order sufficiency condition (FJ2-SSOSC),
	and then show, without any constraint qualification (CQ), that (i)
	if an FJ point z satisfies the FJ1-SSOSC, then there exists a neighborhood
	N(z) of z such that, for any FJ point y is an element of N(z)\{z},
	f(0)(y) not equal f(0)(z), where f(0) is the objective function of
	the problem; (ii) if an FJ point z satisfies the FJZ-SSOSC, then
	z is a strict local minimum of the problem. The result (i) implies
	that the entire iteration point sequence generated by the method

	inequality constrained optimization problems. This method uses a
	linearly constrained positive semidefinite quadratic problem to generate
	a feasible descent direction at each iteration. Under mild assumptions,
	the algorithm is shown to be globally convergent in the sense that
	every accumulation point of the sequence generated by the algorithm
	is a Fritz-John point of the problem. We introduce a Fritz-John (FJ)
	function, an FJ1 strong second-order sufficiency condition (FJ1-SSOSC),
	and an FJ2 strong second-order sufficiency condition (FJ2-SSOSC),
	and then show, without any constraint qualification (CQ), that (i)
	if an FJ point z satisfies the FJ1-SSOSC, then there exists a neighborhood
	N(z) of z such that, for any FJ point y is an element of N(z)\{z},
	f(0)(y) not equal f(0)(z), where f(0) is the objective function of
	the problem; (ii) if an FJ point z satisfies the FJZ-SSOSC, then
	z is a strict local minimum of the problem. The result (i) implies
	that the entire iteration point sequence generated by the method
	converges to an FJ point. We also show that if the parameters are
	chosen large enough, a unit step length can be accepted by the proposed

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an approach for constructing uncertainty
	sets for robust optimization using new deviation measures for random
	variables termed the forward and backward deviations. These deviation
	measures capture distributional asymmetry and lead to better approximations
	of chance constraints. Using a linear decision rule, we also propose
	a tractable approximation approach for solving a class of multistage
	chance-constrained stochastic linear optimization problems. An attractive
	feature of the framework is that we convert the original model into
	a second-order cone program, which is computationally tractable both
	in theory and in practice. We demonstrate the framework through an
	application of a project management problem with uncertain activity
	completion time.},

  abstract = {Stochastic optimization, especially multistage models, is well known

	exact specifications of the probability distributions of the underlying
	uncertainties, which are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose
	tractable methods of addressing a general class of multistage stochastic
	optimization problems, which assume only limited information of the
	distributions of the underlying uncertainties, such as known mean,
	support, and covariance. One basic idea of our methods is to approximate
	the recourse decisions via decision rules. We first examine linear
	decision rules in detail and show that even for problems with complete
	recourse, linear decision rules can be inadequate and even lead to
	infeasible instances. Hence, we propose several new decision rules
	that improve upon linear decision rules, while keeping the approximate
	models computationally tractable. Specifically, our approximate models
	are in the forms of the so-called second-order cone (SOC) programs,
	which could be solved efficiently both in theory and in practice.
	We also present computational evidence indicating that our approach
	is a viable alternative, and possibly advantageous, to existing stochastic
	optimization solution techniques in solving a two-stage stochastic
	optimization problem with complete recourse.},

  journal = {Mathematical Methods of Operations Research},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {65},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop approximation algorithms for two-stage convex
	chance constrained problems. Nemirovski and Shapiro (Probab Randomized
	Methods Des Uncertain 2004) formulated this class of problems and
	proposed an ellipsoid-like iterative algorithm for the special case
	where the impact function f (x, h) is bi-affine. We show that this
	algorithm extends to bi-convex f (x, h) in a fairly straightforward
	fashion. The complexity of the solution algorithm as well as the
	quality of its output are functions of the radius r of the largest
	Euclidean ball that can be inscribed in the polytope defined by a
	random set of linear inequalities generated by the algorithm (Nemirovski
	and Shapiro in Probab Randomized Methods Des Uncertain 2004). Since
	the polytope determining r is random, computing r is difficult. Yet,
	the solution algorithm requires r as an input. In this paper we provide
	some guidance for selecting r. We show that the largest value of
	r is determined by the degree of robust feasibility of the two-stage
	chance constrained problem-the more robust the problem, the higher
	one can set the parameter r. Next, we formulate ambiguous two-stage
	chance constrained problems. In this formulation, the random variables
	defining the chance constraint are known to have a fixed distribution;
	however, the decision maker is only able to estimate this distribution
	to within some error. We construct an algorithm that solves the ambiguous
	two-stage chance constrained problem when the impact function f (x,
	h) is bi-affine and the extreme points of a certain "dual" polytope
	are known explicitly.},

	current state, is non-convex. A recent breakthrough has been the
	application of robust optimization techniques to reparameterize this
	problem as a convex program. While the reparameterized problem is
	theoretically tractable, the number of variables is quadratic in
	the number of stages or horizon length N and has no apparent exploitable
	structure, leading to computational time of O( N-6) per iteration

	the cost function involves the minimization of a quadratic cost.
	Here we make use of state variables to regain a sparse problem structure
	that is related to the structure of the original problem, that is,
	the policy optimization problem may be decomposed into a set of coupled
	finite horizon control problems. This decomposition can then be formulated
	as a highly structured quadratic program, solvable by primal-dual
	interior-point methods in which each iteration requires O( N-3) time.
	This cubic iteration time can be guaranteed using a Riccati-based
	block factorization technique, which is standard in discrete-time
	optimal control. Numerical results are presented, using a standard
	sparse primal-dual interior point solver, that illustrate the efficiency

	 If you are invoking as via the GNU C compiler, you can use the -Wa

	of the primal stochastic LP, and a lower bound is obtained from a
	restriction of a reformulation of the dual. Our "restricted-recourse
	bounds" are more general and more easily computed than most other
	bounds because random coefficients may appear anywhere in the LP,
	neither independence nor boundedness of the coefficients is needed,
	and the bound is computed by solving a single LP or nonlinear program.
	Analytical examples demonstrate that the new bounds can be stronger
	than complementary Jensen bounds. (An upper bound is "complementary"
	to a lower bound, and vice versa). In computational work, we apply
	the bounds to a two-stage stochastic program for semiconductor manufacturing
	with uncertain demand and production rates.},

	of both these problems, same as those of other scaling problems for
	nonnegative multiindex arrays, can be reduced to a specific Geometric
	Programming problem. For the latter problem, we develop a polynomial-time
	algorithm, thus deriving polynomial time solvability of a number
	of generic scaling problems for nonnegative multiindex arrays. Our
	results extend those previously known for the problems of matrix
	balancing [3] and of double-stochastic scaling of a square nonnegative
	matrix [2]. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights

  abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical foundation for efficient interior-point
	algorithms for convex programming problems expressed in conic form,
	when the cone and its associated barrier are self-scaled. For such
	problems we devise long-step and symmetric primal-dual methods. Because
	of the special properties of these cones and barriers, our algorithms
	can take steps that go typically a large fraction of the way to the
	boundary of the feasible region, rather than being confined to a
	ball of unit radius in the local norm defined by the Hessian of the
	barrier.},

	Subject to a resource constraint, the interdictor installs sensors
	on a subset of the network's arcs to minimize the value of the evader's
	maximum-reliability path, i.e., to maximize the detection probability.
	When this decision is made, the evader's origin-destination pair
	is known to the interdictor only through a probability distribution.
	Our model is framed as a stochastic mixed-integer program and solved
	by an enhanced L-shaped decomposition method. Our primary enhancement
	is via a valid inequality, which we call a step inequality. In earlier
	work [Morton et al., IIE Trans 39 (2007), 3-14], we developed step
	inequalities for the special case in which the evader encounters
	at most one sensor on an origin-destination path. Here, we generalize
	the step inequality to the case where the evader encounters multiple
	sensors. In this more general setting, the step inequality is tightly
	coupled to the decomposition scheme. An efficient separation algorithm
	identifies violated step inequalities and strengthens the linear
	programming relaxation of the L-shaped method's master program. We
	apply this solution procedure with further computational enhancements
	to a collection of test problems. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model with uncertain
	data for performance assessment of electricity distribution companies.
	During the past two decades, DEA has been widely used for benchmarking
	the electricity distribution companies. However, there is no study
	among many existing DEA approaches where the uncertainty in data
	is allowed and, at the same time, the distribution of the random
	data is permitted to be unknown. The proposed method of this paper
	develops a new DEA method with the consideration of uncertainty on
	output parameters. The method is based on the adaptation of recently
	developed robust optimization approaches proposed by Ben-Tal and
	Nemirovski [2000. Robust solutions of linear programming problems
	contaminated with uncertain data. Mathematical Programming 88, 411-4211]
	and Bertsimas et al. [2004. Robust linear optimization under general
	norms. Operations Research Letters 32, 510-5161]. The results are
	compared with an existing parametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis
	(SFA) using data from 38 electricity distribution companies in Iran
	to show the effects of the data uncertainties on the performance
	of DEA outputs. The results indicate that the robust DEA approach
	can be a relatively more reliable method for efficiency estimating
	and ranking strategies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper presents Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model with uncertain
	data for performance assessment of electricity distribution companies.
	During the past two decades, DEA has been widely used for benchmarking
	the electricity distribution companies. However, there is no study
	among many existing DEA approaches where the uncertainty in data
	is allowed and, at the same time, the distribution of the random
	data is permitted to be unknown. The proposed method of this paper
	develops a new DEA method with the consideration of uncertainty on
	output parameters. The method is based on the adaptation of recently
	developed robust optimization approaches proposed by Ben-Tal and
	Nemirovski [2000. Robust solutions of linear programming problems
	contaminated with uncertain data. Mathematical Programming 88, 411-4211]
	and Bertsimas et al. [2004. Robust linear optimization under general
	norms. Operations Research Letters 32, 510-5161]. The results are
	compared with an existing parametric Stochastic Frontier Analysis
	(SFA) using data from 38 electricity distribution companies in Iran
	to show the effects of the data uncertainties on the performance
	of DEA outputs. The results indicate that the robust DEA approach
	can be a relatively more reliable method for efficiency estimating
	and ranking strategies. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	years with the rapid expansion of the Internet. Although much has
	been written about the implementation, as well as the formal analysis
	of online models, little has been said about how to handle uncertainty
	in an online setting. In particular, the dynamic nature of uncertainty
	that is so characteristic of online models, where estimates and distributions
	evolve in parallel with the state of the model, has been largely
	ignored. In this paper, we present a new representation for uncertainty
	in online models. This representation is object-oriented and, as
	such, provides several important software-engineering advantages
	over traditional representations for uncertainty. Moreover, by using
	the event listener paradigm it provides an explicit mechanism for
	handling dynamic uncertainty in an elegant and extensible manner.
	A series of computational experiments demonstrates that there is
	no significant overhead to our representation when compared to traditional
	representations on a realistic application and, in some cases, our
	representation can be noticeably faster.},

	years with the rapid expansion of the Internet. Although much has
	been written about the implementation, as well as the formal analysis
	of online models, little has been said about how to handle uncertainty
	in an online setting. In particular, the dynamic nature of uncertainty
	that is so characteristic of online models, where estimates and distributions
	evolve in parallel with the state of the model, has been largely
	ignored. In this paper, we present a new representation for uncertainty
	in online models. This representation is object-oriented and, as
	such, provides several important software-engineering advantages
	over traditional representations for uncertainty. Moreover, by using
	the event listener paradigm it provides an explicit mechanism for
	handling dynamic uncertainty in an elegant and extensible manner.
	A series of computational experiments demonstrates that there is
	no significant overhead to our representation when compared to traditional
	representations on a realistic application and, in some cases, our
	representation can be noticeably faster.},

	stochastic optimization problems by using Monte Carlo simulation.
	In this technique the expected objective function of the stochastic

	a random sample. The resulting sample average approximating problem
	is then solved by deterministic optimization techniques. The process
	is repeated with different samples to obtain candidate solutions
	along with statistical estimates of their optimality gaps. We present
	a detailed computational study of the application of the SAA method
	to solve three classes of stochastic routing problems. These stochastic
	problems involve an extremely large number of scenarios and first-stage
	integer variables. For each of the three problem classes, we use
	decomposition and branch-and-cut to solve the approximating problem
	within the SAA scheme. Our computational results indicate that the
	proposed method is successful in solving problems with up to 2(1694)
	scenarios to within an estimated 1.0% of optimality. Furthermore,
	a surprising observation is that the number of optimality cuts required
	to solve the approximating problem to optimality does not significantly
	increase with the size of the sample. Therefore, the observed computation
	times needed to find optimal solutions to the approximating problems
	grow only linearly with the sample size. As a result, we are able
	to find provably near-optimal solutions to these difficult stochastic
	programs using only a moderate amount of computation time.},

	to solve three classes of stochastic routing problems. These stochastic
	problems involve an extremely large number of scenarios and first-stage
	integer variables. For each of the three problem classes, we use
	decomposition and branch-and-cut to solve the approximating problem
	within the SAA scheme. Our computational results indicate that the
	proposed method is successful in solving problems with up to 2(1694)
	scenarios to within an estimated 1.0% of optimality. Furthermore,
	a surprising observation is that the number of optimality cuts required
	to solve the approximating problem to optimality does not significantly
	increase with the size of the sample. Therefore, the observed computation
	times needed to find optimal solutions to the approximating problems
	grow only linearly with the sample size. As a result, we are able
	to find provably near-optimal solutions to these difficult stochastic
	programs using only a moderate amount of computation time.},
